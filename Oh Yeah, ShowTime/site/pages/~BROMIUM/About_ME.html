            <br>
            <p>                My name is Charles Andrew Bruce Cummins, I am a wannabe Game Developer 
                who mainly works on modifications for video games and tinkers around with "Unreal Engine." 
                You'll usually find me surrounded by the people who mean the most to me—my awesome family of five. 
                There's my mom, Katie, whose the heart and soul of our household, and my dad, Bruce, who's basically 
                the real-life Kratos with his strong presence and protective nature. Then there's my older sister, 
                Elizabeth, who's always ready to share a laugh or two, and my little bro, Sam, who keeps us on our toes
                 with his endless energy.
            <br>
                            Growing up here in Wisconsin Rapids has been an adventure in itself. From exploring the winding trails along the Wisconsin River to cozying up by the fireplace during chilly evenings, every moment feels like a scene straight out of a storybook. And let's not forget about our five furry friends—our cats—who bring so much joy and laughter into our lives. Whether they're causing mischief or snuggling up for a cuddle, they're an essential part of our family dynamic.
                <br>
                <br>
                                As I step into adulthood, I carry with me the values instilled in me by my upbringing: resilience, love, and the importance of cherishing the simple things in life. So here's to embracing each day with open arms and finding beauty in the little moments.
                <br>
                <br>
                                Lastly there is a video I would like to show you a video of my father lifting a log that I watch from time to time. Hopefully you will watch it the same way I do.
